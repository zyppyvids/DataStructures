### Description
Data structures I have personally implemented in university and outside of it.

### Installation
Depends on the language you choose to start the structures in. Generally just build the project and start it - there should be some default tests and a description in the main file of the projects.

### Usage
None currently. ;)

### Contribution
The default guidelines: 
* [you think you know more than me] -> [you make a fork] -> [you fix a bug] -> [you make a PR] -> [if you are correct I accept, if not I decline]

### Test-Instructions
Again, depends on the language.
